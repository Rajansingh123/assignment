<h1>Future car Traders</h1>
<p>Whether you’re selling or trading your vehicle to Enterprise Car Sales, we focus on making it easy on you. We’ve organized a few car trade-in tips to get you ready before heading to your complimentary trade-in appraisal at any of our dealerships.
</p>
<p>Learn more about how Enterprise Car Sales appraises your vehicle. By understanding our process, you can be comfortable and confident in how we determine your vehicle’s value.
</p>
Go into the process with an idea of how much your used car trade-in is worth. We use Kelley Blue Book® to determine the trade-in value of your vehicle.
Here are a few items you should bring when you’re selling or trading in your car: Title and/or lienholder payoff information, current valid state-issued photo ID, all keys and remotes, current and valid vehicle registration. This will help the appraisal go quickly and smoothly. If you don’t have all of these items, don’t worry, we’d still love the opportunity to appraise your vehicle.</p>
